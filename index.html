			<h2>Previous Assignments</h2>
			<p> About Me (Sprint 1): This assignment was the first time I&rsquo;ve ever working with HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. I included a picture of myself, my contact infor and sub-headings such as: introduction,
                what I hope to learn in this course, my favorite hobby / activity, and a fun fact about myself.<br><br>
                Web Resume (Sprint 2): I was able to write my current resume that I created in Microsoft Word in Visual Studio Code using HTML and CSS. My resume was created from feedback by school counselors and mentors I've met 
                over the years outside of school. I was also able to include a PDF printable version of my resume on my web page.<br><br>
                Dice Roller (Sprint 2): I am in the process of creating an interactive web application that involves a dice being rolled to generate random numbers. Not complete yet. <br><br>
                Getting to Know Each Other - Teams (Sprint 3): This was the first group project as a team where we had to create a GitHub organization, a public GitHub repository in the organization, and at least two Azure static
                websites. Our webpage included work in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
                Dice Roller remote RESTful API with Node.js (Sprint 3): For this project I created a website that will serve as WebService API for my Dice Roller application.<br><br>
                Health Insurance Risk Calculator for the Web As A Team (Sprint 4): We worked in teams again to create a Web application that will calculate the health risk of a new insurance company utilizing an Azure Static Web App
                and following the associated Quickstart for the client, add an API to the Azure Static Web App with Azure functions to implement all calculations, and utilizing a new GitHub organization to manage the two seperate Shared 
                GitHub repositories.
